# Stat545 Assignment 3: Data Exploration and Manipulation

This is my submission for assignment 3 of the 2018 iteration of the Stat545 course at UBC.

The previous assignment dealt with exploring and subsetting datasets using dplyr and ggplot2. In this assignment we go a step further and use these tools to approach specific tasks, each of which culminates in a table and graph.

Please refer to [dplyr-exercise.md](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students/hw03-shreeramsenthi/blob/master/dplyr-exercise.md) for the exercise along with relevant code and figures.
